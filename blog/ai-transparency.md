# AI Transparency Statement

All blog posts on this site are written by me.  I use LLMs for editing and
stylistic improvements.  I use generative tools to help refine grammar, improve
clarity, or polish the writing style, but the substance and original thinking
are my own.

I also routinely use LLMs to give me ideas for how to simplify ideas and
as a sparring partner in brain storming of blog posts.

You can find the prompts I usually use [in the
repository](https://github.com/mitsuhiko/lucumr/tree/main/.claude/commands).

And yes, I'm a [long time user](/2007/5/21/getting-started-with-wsgi/) of em-dashes ;)
