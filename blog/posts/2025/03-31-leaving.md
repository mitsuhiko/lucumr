# I'm Leaving Sentry

Every ending marks a new beginning, and today, is the beginning of a new
chapter for me.  Ten years ago I took a leap into the unknown, today I
take another.  After a decade of working on [Sentry](https://sentry.io/) I move on to start something new.

Sentry has been more than just a job, it has been a defining part of my
life.  A place where I've poured my energy, my ideas, my heart.  It has
shaped me, just as I've shaped it.  And now, as I step away, I do so with
immense gratitude, a deep sense of pride, and a heart full of memories.

## From A Chance Encounter

I've known David, Sentry's co-founder (alongside Chris), long before I was
ever officially part of the team as our paths first crossed on IRC in the
Django community.  Even [my first commit](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry/commit/7b82413ce9a011ffca14aa8e98721211aabad77e)
to Sentry predates me officially working there by a few years.  Back in
2013, over conversations in the middle of Russia — at a conference that,
incidentally, also led to me meeting my wife — we toyed with the idea of
starting a company together.  That exact plan didn't materialize, but the
seeds of collaboration had been planted.

Conversations continued, and by late 2014, the opportunity to help
transform Sentry (which already showed product market fit) into a much
bigger company was simply too good to pass up.  I never could have
imagined just how much that decision would shape the next decade of my
life.

## To A Decade of Experiences

For me, Sentry's growth has been nothing short of extraordinary.  At
first, I thought reaching 30 employees would be our ceiling.  Then we
surpassed that, and the milestones just kept coming — reaching a unicorn
valuation was something I once thought was impossible.  While we may have
stumbled at times, we've also learned immensely throughout this time.

I'm grateful for all the things I got to experience and there never was a
dull moment.  From representing Sentry at conferences, opening an
engineering office in Vienna, growing teams, helping employees, assisting
our licensing efforts and leading our internal platform teams.  Every step
and achievement drove me.

Yet for me, the excitement and satisfaction of being so close to the
founding of a company, yet not quite a founder, has only intensified my
desire to see the rest of it.

## A Hard Goodbye

Walking away from something you love is never easy and leaving Sentry is
hard.  Really hard.  Sentry has been woven into the very fabric of my
adult life.  Working on it hasn't just spanned any random decade; it
perfectly overlapped with marrying my wonderful wife, and growing our
family from zero to three kids.

And will it go away entirely?  The office is right around the corner
afterall.  From now on, every morning, when I will grab my coffee, I will
walk past it.  The idea of no longer being part of the daily decisions,
the debates, the momentum — it feels surreal.  That sense of belonging to
a passionate team, wrestling with tough decisions, chasing big wins,
fighting fires together, sometimes venting about our missteps and
discussing absurd and ridiculous trivia became part of my identity.

There are so many bright individuals at Sentry, and I'm incredibly proud
of what we have built together.  Not just from an engineering point of
view, but also product, marketing and upholding our core values.  We
developed SDKs that support a wide array of platforms from [Python](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-python) to [JavaScript](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-javascript) to [Swift](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-cocoa) to [C++](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-native), lately expanding to game
consoles.  We stayed true to our Open Source principles, even when other
options were available.  For example, when we needed an Open Source PDB
implementation for analyzing Windows crashes but couldn't find a suitable
solution, we contributed to a promising Rust crate instead of relying on
Windows VMs and Microsoft's dbghelp.  When we started, our ingestion
system handled a few thousand requests per second — now it handles well
over a million.

While building an SDK may seem straightforward, maintaining and updating
them to remain best-in-class over the years requires immense dedication.
It takes determination to build something that works out of the box with
little configuration.  A lot of clever engineering and a lot of deliberate
tradeoffs went into the product to arrive where it is.  And ten years
later, is a multi-product company.  What started with just crashes, now
you can send traces, profiles, sessions, replays and more.

We also stuck to our values.  I'm pleased that we ran [experiments with
licensing](/2023/11/19/cathedral-and-bazaaar-licensing/) despite all
the push back we got over the years.  We might not have found the right
solution yet, but we pushed the conversation.  The same goes for our
commitment to [funding of dependencies](https://fair.io/).

## And Heartfelt Thank You

I feel an enormous amount of gratitude for those last ten years.  There
are so many people I owe thanks to.  I owe eternal thanks to [David Cramer](https://cra.mr/) and [Chris Jennings](http://chriskjennings.com/)
for the opportunity and trust they placed in me. To [Ben Vinegar](https://benv.ca/) for his unwavering guidance and support.  To [Dan
Levine](https://www.accel.com/people/daniel-levine), for investing in
us and believing in our vision.  To [Daniel Griesser](https://www.linkedin.com/in/daniel-griesser-a8407b3b/), for being an
exceptional first hire in Vienna, and shepherding our office there and
growing it to 50 people.  To [Vlad Cretu](https://www.linkedin.com/in/vlad-cretu-139a0244/), for bringing
structure to our chaos over the years.  To [Milin Desai](https://x.com/virtualmilin) for taking the helm and growing us.

And most of all, to my wonderful wife, Maria — who has stood beside me
through every challenge, who has supported me when the road was uncertain,
and who has always encouraged me to forge my own path.

To everyone at Sentry, past and present — thank you.  For the trust, the
lessons, the late nights, the victories.  For making Sentry what it is
today.

## Quo eo?

I'm fully aware it's a gamble to believe my next venture will find the
same success as Sentry.  The reality is that startups that achieve the
kind of scale and impact Sentry has are incredibly rare.  There's a
measure of hubris in assuming lightning strikes twice, and as humbling as
that realization is, it also makes me that much more determined.  The
creative spark that fueled me at Sentry isn't dimming.  Not at all in
fact: it burns brighter fueld by the feeling that I can explore new
things, beckoning me.  There's more for me to explore, and I'm ready to
channel all that energy into a new venture.

Today, I stand in an open field, my backpack filled with experiences and a
renewed sense of purpose.  That's because the world has changed a lot in
the past decade, and so have I.  What drives me now is different from what
drove me before, and I want my work to reflect that evolution.

At my core, I'm still inspired by the same passion — seeing others find
value in what I create, but my perspective has expanded.  While I still
take great joy in building things that help developers, I want to broaden
my reach.  I may not stray far from familiar territory, but I want to
build something that speaks to more people, something that, hopefully,
even my children will find meaningful.

Watch this space, as they say.
