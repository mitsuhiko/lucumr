# Your MCP Doesn't Need 30 Tools: It Needs Code

I wrote a while back about why [code performs better than
MCP](/2025/7/3/tools/) for some tasks. In particular, I pointed out that if
you have command line tools available, agentic coding tools seem very happy to
use those. In the meantime, I learned a few more things that put some nuance
to this. There are a handful of challenges with CLI-based tools that are
rather hard to resolve and require further examination.

In this blog post, I want to present the (not so novel) idea that an
interesting approach is using MCP servers exposing a single tool, that accepts
programming code as tool inputs.

## CLI Challenges

The first and most obvious challenge with CLI tools is that they are sometimes
platform-dependent, version-dependent, and at times undocumented. This has
meant that I routinely encounter failures when using tools on first use.

A good example of this is when the tool usage requires non-ASCII string inputs.
For instance, Sonnet and Opus are both sometimes unsure how to feed newlines or
control characters via shell arguments.  This is unfortunate but ironically
not entirely unique to shell tools either.  For instance, when you program with
C and compile it, trailing newlines are needed.  At times, agentic coding tools
really struggle with appending an empty line to the end of a file, and you can
find some quite impressive tool loops to work around this issue.

This becomes particularly frustrating when your tool is absolutely not in the
training set and uses unknown syntax.  In that case, getting agents to use it
can become quite a frustrating experience.

Another issue is that in some agents (Claude Code in particular), there is an
extra pass taking place for shell invocations: the security preflight.  Before
executing a tool, Claude also runs it through the fast Haiku model to determine
if the tool will do something dangerous and avoid the invocation.  This further
slows down tool use when multiple turns are needed.

In general, doing multiple turns is very hard with CLI tools because you need
to teach the agent how to manage sessions.  A good example of this is when you
ask it to use [tmux for remote-controlling an LLDB
session](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tg61cevJthc).  It's absolutely capable
of doing it, but it can lose track of the state of its tmux session.  During
some tests, I ended up with it renaming the session halfway through,
forgetting that it had a session (and thus not killing it).

This is particularly frustrating because the failure case can be that it
starts from scratch or moves on to other tools just because it got a small
detail wrong.

## Composability

Unfortunately, when moving to MCP, you immediately lose the ability to compose
without inference (at least today).  One of the reasons lldb can be
remote-controlled with tmux at all is that the agent manages to compose quite
well.  How does it do that?  It uses basic tmux commands such as `tmux
send-keys` to send inputs or `tmux capture-pane` to get the output, which don't
require a lot of extra tooling.  It then chains commands like `sleep` and `tmux
capture-pane` to ensure it doesn't read output too early.  Likewise, when it
starts to fail with encoding more complex characters, it sometimes changes its
approach and might even use `base64 -d`.

The command line really isn't just one tool — it's a series of tools that
can be composed through a programming language: bash.  The most interesting
uses are when you ask it to write tools that it can reuse later.  It will start
composing large scripts out of these one-liners.  All of that is hard with MCP
today.

## Better Approach To MCP?

It's very clear that there are limits to what these shell tools can do.  At
some point, you start to fight those tools.  They are in many ways only as good
as their user interface, and some of these user interfaces are just
inherently tricky.  For instance, when evaluated, [tmux performs better than
GNU screen](https://mariozechner.at/posts/2025-08-15-mcp-vs-cli/), largely
because the command-line interface of tmux is better and less error-prone.  But
either way, it requires the agent to maintain a stateful session, and it's not
particularly good at this today.

What is stateful out of the box, however, is MCP.  One surprisingly useful way
of running an MCP server is to make it an MCP server with a single tool (the
ubertool) which is just a Python interpreter that runs [`eval()` with retained
state](https://github.com/mitsuhiko/pexpect-mcp/blob/main/src/pexpect_mcp/server.py).
It maintains state in the background and exposes tools that the agent already
knows how to use.

I did this experiment in a few ways now, the one that is public is
[`pexpect-mcp`](https://github.com/mitsuhiko/pexpect-mcp/).  It's an MCP that
exposes a single tool called `pexpect_tool`.  It is, however, in many ways a
misnomer.  It's not really a `pexpect` tool — it's a Python interpreter running
out of a virtualenv that has `pexpect` installed.

What is `pexpect`?  It is the Python port of the ancient `expect` command-line
tool which allows one to interact with command-line programs through scripts.
The documentation describes `expect` as a "program that 'talks' to other
interactive programs according to a script."

What is special about `pexpect` is that it's old, has a stable API, and has been
used all over the place.  You could wrap `expect` or `pexpect` with lots of
different MCP tools like `pexpect_expect`, `pexpect_sendline`, `pexpect_spawn`,
and more.  That's because the `pexpect.Spawn` class exposes 36 different API
functions!  That's a lot.  But many of these cannot be used in isolation well
anyway.  Take this motivating example from the docs:

```python
child = pexpect.spawn('scp foo user@example.com:.')
child.expect('Password:')
child.sendline(mypassword)
```

Even the most basic use here involves three chained tool calls.  And that doesn't
include error handling, which one might also want to encode.

So instead, a much more interesting way to have this entire thing run is to just
have the command language to the MCP be Python.  The MCP server turns into a
stateful Python interpreter, and the tool just lets it send Python code
that is evaluated with the same state as before.  There is some extra support
in the MCP server to make the experience more reliable (like timeout support),
but for the most part, the interface is to just send Python code.  In fact, the
exact script from above is what an MCP client is expected to send.

The tool description just says this:

```
Execute Python code in a pexpect session. Can spawn processes and interact with
them.

Args:
  `code`: Python code to execute. Use 'child' variable to interact with the
  spawned process. The pexpect library is already imported. Use
  `pexpect.spawn(...)` to spawn something. timeout: Optional timeout in seconds.
  If not provided, uses global `TIMEOUT` (default 30s).

Example:
  child = pexpect.spawn('lldb ./mytool')
  child.expect("(lldb)")

Returns:
  The result of the code execution or an error message.
```

This works because the interface to the MCP is now not just individual tools it
has never seen — it's a programming language that it understands very well,
with additional access to an SDK (`pexpect`) that it has also seen and learned
all the patterns from.  We're relegating the MCP to do the thing that it does
really well: session management and guiding the tool through a built-in prompt.

More importantly, the code that it writes is very similar to what it might
put into a reusable script.  There is so little plumbing in the actual MCP
that you can tell the agent after the session to write a reusable pexpect
script from what it learned in the session.  That works because all the
commands it ran are just Python — they're still in the context, and the lift
from that to a reusable Python script is low.

## Do It, Then Do It Again

Now I don't want to bore you too much with lots of Claude output, but I
took a crashing demo app that [Mario
wrote](https://mariozechner.at/posts/2025-08-15-mcp-vs-cli/) and asked it to
debug with LLDB through `pexpect_tool`. Here is what that looked like:

<details><summary>Expand to see entire session</summary>

```

⏺ Let me also look at the source code directly to understand what we're debugging:

⏺ Read(demo-buggy.c)

⏺ Perfect! Now I can see the bugs in the code. Let me continue with the lldb debugging session to demonstrate finding these issues:

⏺ pexpect - pexpect_tool (MCP)(code: "# Force quit\nchild.close()\nprint(\"LLDB session closed\")")
  ⎿  Code executed successfully

⏺ Based on the debugging session with lldb, I've identified the main issues in ./demo-buggy:

  Key Findings:

  1. Segmentation Fault at line 26 (demo-buggy.c:26): The program crashes when trying to write to s->scores[s->num_scores] because s->scores is NULL.
  2. Root Cause: In create_student() function at line 19, the scores array allocation is commented out and set to NULL instead:
  s->scores = NULL;  // This will cause a segfault when we try to write to it
  3. Additional Bug: In calculate_average() at line 34, there's an off-by-one error:
  for (int i = 0; i <= s->num_scores; i++) {  // BUG: <= should be <

  Debug Session Summary:

  - The program crashes immediately when add_score(alice, 95.5) is called
  - The backtrace shows the crash occurs in the add_score function
  - The s->scores pointer is NULL, causing the segfault when dereferencing
  - The crash happens before reaching the second bug in calculate_average()

  The lldb session successfully identified the exact location and cause of the crash, demonstrating how to use the debugger to trace segmentation faults back to
  their source.
```

</details>

Afterwards I asked it to dump it into a reusable Python script to be run later:

<details><summary>The prompt that wrote the script</summary>

```
> now that you wrote this pexpect script, could you dump out a python script
  file with those pscript commands so we can use it again later?

⏺ Write(debug_demo.py)
  ⎿  Wrote 95 lines to debug_demo.py
     #!/usr/bin/env python3
     """
     Debug script for demo-buggy using pexpect and lldb.
     This script automates the debugging session to identify the segfault.
     """
     import pexpect
     import sys
     def debug_demo_buggy():
     … +85 lines (ctrl+r to expand)

⏺ Created debug_demo.py - you can now run python debug_demo.py to
   replay the entire debugging session automatically.
```

</details>

And from a fresh session we can ask it to execute it once more:

```
> please run debug_demo.py with uv run to figure out what's going on

⏺ Bash(uv run debug_demo.py)
  ⎿  Starting lldb debugging session for ./demo-buggy
     ✓ LLDB started successfully
     … +155 lines (ctrl+r to expand)

⏺ The debug script successfully ran and identified the issue! Here's what it found:

  Main Problem: The demo-buggy executable crashes with a segfault in the add_score()
  function because s->scores is NULL (not allocated memory).

  Root Cause: Line 18 in create_student() is commented out, which means the scores
  array is never allocated.

  Fix: Uncomment line 18 in the create_student() function to allocate memory for the
  scores array.

  Additional Issue: There's also an off-by-one error in the calculate_average()
  function.

  The debugging session shows that:
  1. LLDB successfully launched and set a breakpoint at main
  2. The program stopped at the breakpoint
  3. It identified that alice and bob Student pointers were created
  4. The crash occurs when trying to access unallocated memory for scores

  This demonstrates that the pexpect MCP tool is working correctly for debugging C
  programs with LLDB!
```

That again works because the code it writes into the MCP is very close to the
code that it would write into a Python script.  And the difference is
meaningful.  The initial debug takes about 45 seconds on my machine and uses
about 7 tool calls.  The re-run with the dumped playbook takes one tool call
and finishes in less than 5 seconds.  Most importantly: that script is
standalone.  I can run it as a human, even without the MCP!

## Novel Things

Now the above example works beautifully because these models just know so much
about `pexpect`.  That's hardly surprising in a way.  So how well does this
work when the code that it should write is entirely unknown to it?  Well, not
quite as well.  However, and this is the key part, because the meta input
language is Python, it means that the total surface area that can be exposed
from an ubertool is pretty impressive.

A general challenge with MCP today is that the more tools you have, the more
you're contributing to context rot.  You're also limited to rather low amounts
of input.  On the other hand, if you have an MCP that exposes a programming
language, it also indirectly exposes a lot of functionality that it knows
from its training.

For instance, one of the really neat parts about this is that it knows `dir()`,
`globals()`, `repr()`, and other stuff.  Heck, it even knows about
`sys._getframe()`.  This means that you can give it very rudimentary
instructions about how its sandbox operates and what it might want to do to
learn more about what is available to it as needed.  You can also tell it in
the prompt that there is a function it can run to learn more about what's
available when it needs help!

So when you build something that is completely novel, at least the programming
language is known. You can, for instance, write a tiny MCP that dumps out the
internal state of your application, provides basic query helpers for your
database that support your sharding setup, or provides data reading APIs.  It
will discover all of this anyway from reading the code, but now it can also
use a stateful Python or JavaScript session to run these tools and explore more.

This is also a fun feature when you want to ask the agent to debug the MCP
itself.  Because Python and JavaScript are so powerful, you can, for instance,
also ask it to debug the MCP's state itself when something went wrong.

## Security Is A Sham

The elephant in the room for all things agentic coding is security.  Claude
mostly doesn't delete your machine and maybe part of that is the Haiku preflight
security check.  But isn't all of this a sham anyway?  I generally love to
watch how Claude and other agents maneuver their way around protections in
pretty creative ways.  Clearly it's potent and prompt-injectable.  By building
an MCP that just runs `eval()`, we might be getting rid of some of the remaining
safety here.

But does it matter?  We are seemingly okay with it writing code and running
tests, which is the same kind of bad as running `eval()`.  I'm sure the day of
reckoning will come for all of us, but right now we're living in this world
where protections don't matter and we can explore what these things can do.

I'm honestly not sure how to best protect these things.  They are pretty
special in that they are just inherently unsafe and impossible to secure.
Maybe the way to really protect them would be to intercept every system call
and have some sort of policy framework/sandbox around the whole thing.
But even in that case, what prevents an ever more clever LLM from circumventing
all these things?  It has internet access, it can be prompt-injected, and
all interfaces we have for them are just too low-level to support protection
well.

So to some degree, I think the tail risks of code execution are here to stay.
But I would argue that they are not dramatically worse when the MCP executes
Python code.  In this particular case, consider that `pexpect` itself runs
programs.  There is little point in securing the MCP if what the MCP can run
is any bash command.

## Taking It Further

As interesting as the `pexpect` case is, that was not my original motivation.
What I started to look into is replacing [Playwright's
MCP](https://github.com/microsoft/playwright-mcp) with an MCP that just exposes
the Playwright API via JavaScript.  This is an experiment I have been running
for a while, and the results are somewhat promising but also not promising
enough yet.  If you want to play with it, the MCP is called
"[playwrightess](https://github.com/mitsuhiko/playwrightess-mcp)" is pretty
simple.  It just lets it execute JavaScript code against a sync playwright
client.  Same idea.  Here, the tool usage is particularly nice because it gets
down from ~30 tool definitions to 1:

The other thing that is just much nicer about this approach is how many more
ways it has to funnel data out.  For instance `console.log` from both the
browser as well as the playwright script are forwarded back to the agent
automatically.  There is no need for the agent to ask for that information,
it comes automatically.  It also has a `state` variable that it can use to
accumulate extra information between calls which it liberally uses if you for
instance ask it to collect data from multiple pages in a pagination.  It can
do that without any further inference, because the loop happens within JavaScript.

Same with `pexpect` — you can easily get it to dump out a script for later
that circumvents a lot of MCP calls with something it already saw.
Particularly when you are debugging a gnarly issue and you need to restart the
debugging more than once, that shows some promise.  Does it perform better than
Playwright MCP?  Not in the current form, but I want to see if this idea can be
taken further.  It is quite verbose in the scripts that it writes, and it is not
really well tuned between screenshots and text extraction.
