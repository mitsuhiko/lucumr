# A Recap

I have been reading a bunch of people's recaps of 2010.  I find that a
wonderful idea because it turns out that after a year you end up doing a
lot and don't appreciate it enough.  And it turns out, 2010 was an amazing
year.  This is my list of Open Source or programming related activities of
2010:

January- Decided to learn game development.  This didn't go too well for a
while though.  I was kinda worn out of Python web development
after four years and wanted to do something new.

April- Made an April's fool joke web framework with a screencast that was
downloaded over 15.000 times.  Some people actually took it serious :)

- Gave a talk about switching to Python 3 at the Linux days in Graz.

- Released Flask, a microframework based on my April's fool joke.  I
learned a lot from that, might be intresting for a talk.

May- Attended DjangoCon in Berlin and gave my first English talk ever.
It didn't go as well as it could have been but I was nervous
as fuck, especially because I was the first talk after the
keynote.

June- Started looking for a Job over the summer holidays and ended up
working with the guys from Lincoln Loop for a larger Django
project.

- Sphinx made it into GSOC under the PSF umbrella and I am mentoring
a student again.

July- Attended EuroPython

August- Finally diving into 3D engine development.  The books I bought a
few months back finally pay off and a painful dive into
mathematics starts.

September- Broke my macbook, needed replacement — expensive month.

- Attended DjangoCon and met friends from Portland again.  Good
times.

October- Held a talk at Pycon PL about new Python idioms.  Had the chance
to talk to finally meet Maciej Fijalkowski in person and a whole
bunch of interesting guys.

- Another talk about Good API Design in Kiev.  First time I was to
Ukraine.

- Relaunched pocoo.org with a new design.  Looked for a bunch of
companies using pocoo Software and was proud seeing where our
stuff ended up beeing.

November- Got invited to ORD Camp 2011.  Feeling honored, but unfortunately
will not be able to attend :(

December- I finally have something that looks rougly like a 3D voxel engine.
Still far from a game, but a start and with that project I learned
a whole lot that year.
