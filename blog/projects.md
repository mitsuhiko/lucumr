# Projects

Over the last couple of years I created and contributed to a number of
Open Source projects.  Most of them were Python and Rust, a couple of
others however were also C, C++, JavaScript, PHP or other languages mixed
in.

This list is widely incomplete, lots of small things can be found on my
[GitHub](https://github.com/mitsuhiko/) profile and some things are lost
in the depths of the internet.

## Commercial Endeavors

Some of the more meaningful commercial projects and initiatives I worked on:

-   [Plurk](http://www.plurk.com/) — the first commercial project I
    worked on.  A microblogging platform similar to Twitter with a unieuq
    timelime.

-   [Fireline](http://fireteam.net/fireline/) — online services platform for games.
    Built by a subsidary of Splash Damage to support internal and external
    games.

-   [Sentry](http://www.getsentry.com/) — error tracking and performance
    monitoring platform.  Initially Open Source, now [Fair Source](https://fair.io/).  There since we raised money, built out an
    office in Austria and lead SDKs and ingestion services for a many
    years.

-   [Functional Software License](https://fsl.software/) — I was part
    of drafting and promoting Sentry's [DOSP](https://opensource.org/delayed-open-source-publication) springing
    license.  An innovative license that comes with a two year exclusivity
    period for the original creator which turns into Apache2/MIT
    afterwards.

-   [Fair Source](https://fair.io/) — the branding term we have
    promoted for FSL style licenses with minimal restrictions that undergo
    DOSP.

-   [Open Source Pledge](https://opensourcepledge.com/) — an initiative
    born at Sentry to encourage companies to pledge to their Open Source
    dependencies.

## Open Source Libraries

This is a selection of some of my more popular Open Source libraries and
projects.  They either became popular on their own, or gave birth to other
Open Source projects later:

-   [Flask](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/) — a microframework for
    Python based on good intentions.  At the time it became one of the
    most popular Python frameworks and has been adopted by many companies
    for internal APIs and microservices.

-   [Pygments](http://pygments.org/) — syntax highlighter written in
    Python.  I created this project together with Georg Brandl in 2005.
    For a while it became a very popular syntax highlighting powering many
    web sites, including GitHub.

-   [Jinja](https://jinja.palletsprojects.com/) — template engine for
    Python.  Originally built as an improved version of Django templates
    for non Django frameworks.  It became popular through Flask and other
    web frameworks and also found home as a template language for
    infrastructure scripting (salt and ansible) as well as LLM prompting.

-   [Sphinx](https://www.sphinx-doc.org/) — a Python documentation tool.
    Like Pygments this was built together with Georg Brandl, oringally as
    a replacement for the old LaTeX based documentation for Python itself.
    It later became popular as a solution to write books and
    documentations for many projects.

-   [Werkzeug](http://werkzeug.pocoo.org/) — WSGI utility library for Python.
    This was originally built to promote the use of WSGI for Python and to
    build applications on top.  Later this became the based of Flask.

-   [Click](https://click.palletsprojects.com/) — a
    command line interface utility library.  I built this to make it
    easier to build command line applications and it has become a very
    popular choice in the Python ecosystem.

-   [Rye](https://github.com/astral-sh/rye) — an experimental package
    manager for Python.  Built for my own use to see what packaging in
    Python could look like it attracted a lot of interest.  The project
    has been donated to astral who are building `uv` as a better,
    spiritual successor.

-   [Twig](http://www.twig-project.org/) — a Django-inspired template
    engine for PHP.  Originally created for a blogging system called
    Chyrp, it took a life on its own when it was taken over by the
    Symfony project.

-   [Babel](http://babel.pocoo.org/) — collection of tools for
    internationalizing Python applications.  Originally built by Edgewall
    software for trac, I maintained it for a while.

-   [Logbook](https://logbook.readthedocs.io/) — a logging library for Python.

-   [itsdangerous](http://pythonhosted.org/itsdangerous) — a
    cryptographic signing library used by Flask and many other libraries.

-   [redis-rs](https://github.com/mitsuhiko/redis-rs) — a redis driver
    for Rust.  Originally built to learn Rust, it has become the most
    popular redis driver.

-   [insta](https://insta.rs/) — a snapshot testing library for Rust.
    Originally built for use at Sentry it has been adopted quite widely
    for an improved snapshot testing experience.

-   [similar](https://insta.rs/similar/) — a diffling library for Rust.
    Originally used for insta, has been independently become widely used.

-   [minijinja](https://github.com/mitsuhiko/minijinja/) — a minimal dependency
    implementation of Jinja2 for Rust.  Built for my own use for an
    unreleased project, it has also been adopted by a number of projects
    and companies for LLM prompting.

## Open Source Applications

-   [Zine](https://web.archive.org/web/20101207045141/http://zine.pocoo.org/) — a
    blog software written in Python.  This has been lost in the archive of the
    internet, but at the time I was very proud of it.  It was a blogging
    platform similar to WordPress for Python. ([archive](https://github.com/mitsuhiko/zine))

-   [Plurk Solace](http://opensource.plurk.com/solace/) — a multilingual
    support application.  Was not used much but it was my first Open
    Source project I was paid for. ([archive](https://github.com/mitsuhiko/solace))

-   [python-modernize](https://github.com/python-modernize/python-modernize) — Python 2 to 3
    porting tool.  I build this to demonstrate that you can build code
    bases that were compatible to both 2.x and 3.x.  It later gave life to
    [modernize](https://python-modernize.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).

-   [pipsi](https://github.com/mitsuhiko/pipsi) — a wrapper around pip
    for script installation that later inspired pipx and things like `uv
    run`.

-   [Lektor](https://www.getlektor.com/) — a static file content
    management system written in Python.

## Computer Games

In a prior life I was credited for my work on some computer games:

-   [Batman Arkham Origins](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Batman:_Arkham_Origins) — parts of online
    services code and backend.

-   [RAD Soldiers](http://www.warchest.com/games/radsoldiers) — game
    backend.

-   [Dirty Bomb](http://dirtybomb.nexon.net/) — online services and game
    backend.

-   [Halo: The Master Chief Collection](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Halo:_The_Master_Chief_Collection) —
    online services consulting.

-   [Gears of War Ultimate Edition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gears_of_War_(video_game)#Ultimate_Edition) —
    online services consulting.

## Projects for Competitions

-   ["Be a Bee"](http://www.aec.at/prix_history_en.php?year=2003) — for
    u19, Ars Electronica 2003. 2nd Place.  In some ways what got me more
    excited about programming and creating things.
