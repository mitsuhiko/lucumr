  Recapitulation of my accomplishments and interesting events related to
  computing and Open Source of 2010.

A Recap
=======

I have been reading a bunch of people's recaps of 2010.  I find that a
wonderful idea because it turns out that after a year you end up doing a
lot and don't appreciate it enough.  And it turns out, 2010 was an amazing
year.  This is my list of Open Source or programming related activities of
2010:

January
    -   Decided to learn game development.  This didn't go too well for a
        while though.  I was kinda worn out of Python web development
        after four years and wanted to do something new.

April
    -   Made an April's fool joke web framework with a screencast that was
        downloaded over 15.000 times.  Some people actually took it serious :)
    -   Gave a talk about switching to Python 3 at the Linux days in Graz.
    -   Released Flask, a microframework based on my April's fool joke.  I
        learned a lot from that, might be intresting for a talk.

May
    -   Attended DjangoCon in Berlin and gave my first English talk ever.
        It didn't go as well as it could have been but I was nervous
        as fuck, especially because I was the first talk after the
        keynote.

June
    -   Started looking for a Job over the summer holidays and ended up
        working with the guys from Lincoln Loop for a larger Django
        project.
    -   Sphinx made it into GSOC under the PSF umbrella and I am mentoring
        a student again.

July
    -   Attended EuroPython

August
    -   Finally diving into 3D engine development.  The books I bought a
        few months back finally pay off and a painful dive into
        mathematics starts.

September
    -   Broke my macbook, needed replacement â€” expensive month.
    -   Attended DjangoCon and met friends from Portland again.  Good
        times.

October
    -   Held a talk at Pycon PL about new Python idioms.  Had the chance
        to talk to finally meet Maciej Fijalkowski in person and a whole
        bunch of interesting guys.
    -   Another talk about Good API Design in Kiev.  First time I was to
        Ukraine.
    -   Relaunched pocoo.org with a new design.  Looked for a bunch of
        companies using pocoo Software and was proud seeing where our
        stuff ended up beeing.

November
    -   Got invited to ORD Camp 2011.  Feeling honored, but unfortunately
        will not be able to attend :(

December
    -   I finally have something that looks rougly like a 3D voxel engine.
        Still far from a game, but a start and with that project I learned
        a whole lot that year.
