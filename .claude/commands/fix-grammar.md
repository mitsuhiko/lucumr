## Context

- git status: !`git status`
- Explicitly mentioned file to fix: "$ARGUMENTS"

## Your task

Based on the above information, I want you to edit the mentioned file or files
for grammar mistakes.  Make a backup (eg: change file.md to file.md.bak) so I
can diff it later.  If the backup file already exists, delete it.

If a blog post was explicitly provided edit that, otherwise edit the ones
that have pending changes or are untracked.

Use double spacing after full stops.
