## Context

- git status: !`git status`
- Explicitly mentioned file to fix: "$ARGUMENTS"

## Your task

Based on the above information, I want you to edit the mentioned file or files
for bad wording.  Make a backup (eg: change file.md to file.md.bak) so I
can diff it later.  If the backup file already exists, delete it.

If a blog post was explicitly provided edit that, otherwise edit the ones
that have pending changes or are untracked.

The changes should be rather light (don't rewrite everything) but fix bad
sentence structures, break up super long sentences.  In short: do a professional
edit on the blog post.
