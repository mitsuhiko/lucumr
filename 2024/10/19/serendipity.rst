Serendipity
===========

| Life begins.
| An empty page.
| A hollow echo on an barren stage.
| We wander through the quiet air,
| Unsure of what awaits us there.

| With work and study, I filled the days,
| But purpose wanes in fading haze.
| An emptiness remained inside,
| A restless longing I tried to hide.

| But then a hand, warm in the night,
| Turns the dark to softest light.
| Two souls meet and pledge their vow,
| To fill what life is missing now.

| By chance, our paths became entwined,
| Through joy and laughter, lives combined.
| Soon tiny hands, starry-eyed,
| Fill our home with love and pride.

| With every laugh, with every tear,
| You fill the space, bring kindness near.
| Two hearts become one place,
| Of love and hope,
| a shared embrace.

| My gratitude grows deep and wide,
| For every moment, side by side.
| Through joy, sorrow, pain, persistence,
| You bring meaning to my existence.
