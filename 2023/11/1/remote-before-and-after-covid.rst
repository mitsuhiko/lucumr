summary: What I learned about remote work after covid.

Post Covid Remote Work
======================

*This year I decided that I want to share my most important learnings about
engineering, teams and quite frankly personal mental health.  My hope is that
those who want to learn from me find it useful.*

You can't make it 15 minutes on Twitter or elsewhere, without running into
a post about a botched return to work implementation.  You also can't make
it for very long to hear about the San Francisco doom loop.  These two
topics relate in a quite deep way to me personally.  This post is a
reflection of working at Sentry for almost 10 years, a company primarily
headquartered in San Francisco and how it is to work for it from a
distance before and after Covid.

Cities are Magic
----------------

I'm a being that thrives in cities.  In fact, I'm genuinely amazed every
day how humans have managed to form societies where cities can
function.  But not only function, but function really well.  They are
quite remarkable because they greatly benefit of economies of scale.  You can
provide services in cities that would otherwise not be possible economically,
because there are not enough people around that otherwise are in need of
that service.  As a friend of mine once described: cities are like small
social experiments.  Each city uniquely nurtures specific communities, each
with their own values and ideas.  Since forever I have been a software
developer (amateur or otherwise), there was really only one city heralded as
the city of technology: San Francisco.  It has a profound impact on many of
us, even if we don't live there.

It's not the city I want to live in, in many ways it's running the kind of
social experiment with outcomes I'm not attracted to, but without doubt
that experiment has an impact far beyond it's borders.  I'm in many ways a
beneficiary of it's existence.

Solitude
--------

Where cities shine is collaboration and meeting like-minded folks.  Where I
grew up, I was the only programmer in a tiny town.  If you want to talk
with others about your problems, the internet really was the only place.
I took advantage of the opportunities that IRC, bulletin boards and
mailing lists gave me.  It allowed me to meet people that were otherwise
outside of my reach.

My theory on what makes a successful company or project is collaboration
and some shared, deeply rooted values.  In some ways we sometimes do not
quite know what our values are, we just “get them”.  We get them because
when we talk to each other we get subtle hints about being on the same
page about a topic.  Alongside that there is shared excitement about
subtle, small details or things one could build.  This kind of shared
understanding can exist in a purely virtual form, but that can take years
to foster.  Finding like-minded people through the internet is what
brought me to where I am today.  Yet in many ways as I grew older I also
realize how much harder this is.  Compare this to meeting people in person.
A day in person with another human being can replace a week of async online
collaboration and a month of chipping away at a problem in isolation.

When I started working on / at Sentry, I already knew enough about `David
<https://cra.mr/>`__ that I knew we're on the same page.  On the other
hand, I also knew that San Francisco wouldn't be the place for me.  So if
I wanted to work on Sentry, I also *had to work hard* to make remote work.
The way I went into remote work for Sentry I was determined to figure out
how to make the situation beneficial for everyone involved.

Making Remote Work
------------------

In early Sentry days I felt a lot of pressure on myself to make my remote
work situation successful.  And I loved that.  It forced me to work
towards finding the advantages in that situation.  Initially this
primarily meant better time zone coverage, but it also meant that I took
customer calls in the early Sentry days to connect with European
prospects.  I managed to compensate for my remoteness in other ways.  I
also intentionally shifted my days to be closer to my US colleagues and
eventually hired more folks around me.

Today there is an engineering office for Sentry in Vienna where I live.
It's not a huge office, but I'm very proud of the accomplishments of the
people working there.  Vienna isn't a city known for it's developer
community, in fact it's probably not known for that much to begin with.
So in many ways having an office here was a gamble.  In a similar way to
how I tried to find reasons for why my remote situation at Sentry works, I
also approached the office in the same manner.  What's the social
experiment that Vienna is running, that aligns with the needs and desires
for our company?  Given that Vienna isn't an engineering hub, the talent
pool is more restricted compared to San Francisco.  On the other hand it
also means that you can create an environment that focuses on retaining
engineers.  Vienna is a great city that enables pleasant commuting, is
comparatively cheap, very international and great for cities.  There is a
genuine reason to work here.  But the point is: both my own work situation
as well as the office I approached with a certain level of anxiety that
made me work for it.

Covid Broke The System
----------------------

And then Covid came.

And quite frankly with Covid a lot changed in fascinating ways.  I will
admit that I completely underestimated the impact that a Covid imposed
remote work environment would have on us.  And not just us, but quite a
few folks around me as well.  How was this possible?  How could remote
work, something I have been practicing for years all the sudden not work?
How could this be so bad for a few months during Covid?

With the power of hindsight I think the biggest difference between before
and after covid remote work, was how we all went into it and how much more
extreme it was.  I spent quite a bit of time talking with others who have
made remote work and it comes down to the same: it's very intentional, and
it involves understanding how to deal with the downsides.  Covid remote
work was nothing like this.

"With the onset of Covid, many individuals who previously had little
experience with remote work suddenly found themselves working from home.
Unlike earlier remote work scenarios where individuals made significant
efforts to adapt, the pandemic brought about a shift in expectations.
Folks rightfully began to demand better support for remote work from us.
And it wasn't just us, I have heard similar stories from lots of others.
In some situations people moved quite far outside the cities where
they worked during Covid.  In some cases that was unavoidable.  When you
have your partner and your kids at home 24/7, you might need a change in
place.  But even after things normalized, the offices were much more
reclusive than before.  The dynamics completely changed.  There were fewer
people in the office and collaboration between teams from different
offices decreased.

This year, I engaged in numerous conversations with various individuals
about the challenges posed by remote work and Covid.  Probably not
entirely surprisingly, very few mentioned any positive impact of Covid
on work culture.  Even more concerning is the negative perception of remote
work in some areas.  This has led to unexpected and stringent return-to-office
policies, affecting even those who were originally working remotely prior
to Covid as collateral damage.

One of the changes with Covid remote is that people work from home that
previously were in the office.  This even includes myself.  This in
practice easily ends up as a net negative unless you compensate in in some
other way.  We miss out on non-verbal communication, spontaneous hallway
chats that can lead to resolution of current issues, and the casual office
banter.

Fixing It With Intention
------------------------

I don't think we can go back to pre-covid life, the world has changed.
What I think we can do, is be more intentional about how we go into this
hybrid work situation.  I believe the biggest improvement from where we
are to where we can be is reflecting actively on the downsides that remote
works gives us.  I **love** remote work, it gave me the ability to work
with great people over the years which would otherwise be impossible for
me to work with.  Yet as you have seen, I'm painfully aware of the downsides
that it brings.  These downsides just need to be more directly addressed
and I believe that sort of addressing only in parts comes from company
and engineering management, it needs to come from everybody.

If you have a remote work force, one needs to find natural opportunities for people
to meet face-to-face.  Even if it's just annual get-togethers of managers.
it's not the catered breakfast or office event that fixes this, it's
the getting together with intention, the fostering meaningful
interactions.  Our hackweeks, for instance, have spurred incredible
collaboration far more than any catered breakfast ever did.  A focused
six-week sprint with a clear but ambitious goal has not only enhances
engagement but also naturally encourages in-person meetings. I've found
that our off-site meetings, which ironically felt like on-site for many,
with a clear objective, have rejuvenated team morale more than any other
initiative.

If you're an employee seeking remote work, it might be beneficial to adopt
a pre-Covid mindset and present a compelling case for it.  The most
desirable companies are likely the ones that uphold rigorous standards for
remote work going forward.  Ensure you have a valid and convincing
rationale for your remote work request.

Scale and Encounters by Chance
------------------------------

If you are a small company, remote is almost natural.  You have
established trust, everybody knows everyone and it doesn't matter that
much how you work.  The office banter might as well be the one slack
channel.  But that just doesn't scale.  That tightly coupled model stops
scaling really, really quick.  Today there is not one slack channel that
has everybody at Sentry in.  And it's not just that.

There is a lot a physical space gives you at scale: you see people's
happiness and frustrations.  You see their motivation or lack thereof.
Working in a larger office is a shared experience.  Everybody feeds off
each other.  We turn from individuals into a shared body.  Sometimes good
things happen, sometimes bad things happen.  Sometimes people run into
each other not just for work reasons but also because they undergo some
other shared concern.  We live in times of war and a climate crisis, and
many of us have friends and families who are affected.  You might not
want to necessarily have these conversations at the work place, but you
will see the despair in your fellow coworkers when you grab a coffee.  You
can reach out, you can talk, you can support.  The best emoji game will
not replace that kind of encounter.
