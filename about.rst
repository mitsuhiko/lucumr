About this Website
------------------

The name of this website came when a friend of mine and me were joking
about what makes a great web 2.0 website.  We came up with three things: it
has to have round corners, fresh colors and a weirdly shortened name.  So
the first version of this blog was green, named after a fresh fruit
(lucuma) and with a destroyed, abbreviated name.  Not much is left from
these days, but the name stuck.

The website itself is written in restructured text and built with a small
script.  Sourcecode can be `found on github
<http://github.com/mitsuhiko/lucumr>`_.
