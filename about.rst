About Me
========

My name is Armin Ronacher and I'm a passionate developer interested in web
development, graphics, realtime rendering and tons of other stuff.  I am
one of the founding members of the `Pocoo Team <http://pocoo.org>`_ and
lead developer on a couple of popular Python projects.

I'm currently located in Austria and working as a partner for `Sentry
<http://www.getsentry.com/>`_ and as an advisor for `Fireteam Ltd.
<http://fireteam.net>`_.  I'm available for on-site teaching,
presentations and certain types of short-term contract work.  Aside from
that I do `open-source </projects/>`_ development and like `giving talks
</talks>`_ at various conferences.

If you want to contact me, you can reach me via one of the following
communication channels:

-   via `email <armin.ronacher@active-4.com>`_
-   send me a message on `github <http://github.com/mitsuhiko>`_ or

All of the open-source stuff I work on is BSD licensed which
means you can do with it whatever you want.

I'm currently not accepting donations but if you have some truly
interesting problems in your company that you think I might be interested
in solving, fire me a mail at `armin@ronacher.eu <armin@ronacher.eu>`_
and maybe we can work together.

About this Website
------------------

The name of this website came when a friend of mine and me were joking
about what makes a great web 2.0 website.  We came up with three things: it
has to have round corners, fresh colors and a weirdly shortened name.  So
the first version of this blog was green, named after a fresh fruit
(lucuma) and with a destroyed, abbreviated name.  Not much is left from
these days, but the name stuck.

The website itself is written in restructured text and built with a small
script.  Sourcecode can be `found on github
<http://github.com/mitsuhiko/lucumr>`_.
