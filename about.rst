About Me
========

My name is Armin Ronacher and I'm a passionate developer interested in web
development, graphics, realtime rendering and tons of other stuff.  I am
one of the founding members of the `Pocoo Team <http://pocoo.org>`_ and
lead developer on a couple of popular Python projects.

I'm currently located in Austria and London and contracting for `Fireteam
Ltd.  <http://fireteam.net>`_.  I'm available for interesting contract
work.  Aside from that I do `open source </projects/>`_ development and
like `giving talks </talks>`_ at various conferences.

If you want to contact me, you can reach me via one of the following
communication channels:

-   via `email <armin.ronacher@active-4.com>`_
-   send me a message on `github <http://github.com/mitsuhiko>`_ or

My usual nickname is `mitsuhiko`.

About this Website
------------------

The name of this website came when a friend of mine and me were joking
about what makes a great web 2.0 website.  We came up with three things: it
has to have round corners, fresh colors and a weirdly shortened name.  So
the first version of this blog was green, named after a fresh fruit
(lucuma) and with a destroyed, abbreviated name.  Not much is left from
these days, but the name stuck.

The website itself is written in restructured text and built with a small
script.  Sourcecode can be `found on github
<http://github.com/mitsuhiko/lucumr>`_.
