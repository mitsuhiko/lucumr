Hi, my name is Armin Ronacher!  I'm deeply passionate about building
teams, creating products, and contributing to the Open Source community.
As a dedicated software developer, I've had the privilege of creating a
number of very popular Open Source projects, including Flask, Jinja2, and
many `other widely used things </projects/>`__.

For a decade, I've `been working on Sentry </2025/3/31/leaving/>`__,
building out one of our regional offices, working on event ingestion, SDKs
and leading the teams for our internal developer platform.  I also love
sharing knowledge and experiences, which is why I give `talks at
conferences and events </talks/>`__ and write about engineering and life
on this blog.

If my work has been valuable to you, I’d greatly appreciate your support
through GitHub sponsors.

All of the open source stuff I work on is liberally licensed which means
you can do with it whatever you want.

I'm currently not available for consulting or contract work, but you can
support my work via GitHub sponsors.

About this Website
------------------

The name of this website came when a friend of mine and me were joking
about what makes a great web 2.0 website.  We came up with three things: it
has to have round corners, fresh colors and a weirdly shortened name.  So
the first version of this blog was green, named after a fresh fruit
(lucuma) and with a destroyed, abbreviated name.  Not much is left from
these days, but the name stuck.

The website itself is written in restructured text and built with a small
script.  Sourcecode can be `found on github
<http://github.com/mitsuhiko/lucumr>`_.
