About Me
========

My name is Armin Ronacher and I'm a passionate developer interested in web
development, graphics, realtime rendering and tons of other stuff.  I am
one of the founding members of the `Pocoo Team <http://pocoo.org>`_ and
lead developer on a couple of popular Python projects.

I'm currently located in Austria and working as a Director of Engineering
for `Sentry <http://www.getsentry.com/>`_.  Aside from that I do `open
source </projects/>`_ development and like `giving talks </talks>`_ at
various conferences and create Open Source software.  If you want to
support my work consider sponsoring me on GitHub.

All of the open source stuff I work on is BSD licensed which
means you can do with it whatever you want.

I'm currently not available for consulting or contract work,
but you can support my work via GitHub sponsors.

About this Website
------------------

The name of this website came when a friend of mine and me were joking
about what makes a great web 2.0 website.  We came up with three things: it
has to have round corners, fresh colors and a weirdly shortened name.  So
the first version of this blog was green, named after a fresh fruit
(lucuma) and with a destroyed, abbreviated name.  Not much is left from
these days, but the name stuck.

The website itself is written in restructured text and built with a small
script.  Sourcecode can be `found on github
<http://github.com/mitsuhiko/lucumr>`_.
